# What is Hoisting in Javascript?

Javascript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

Before we dive into the details of hoisting, let's understand the concept of **scope** in Javascript.

## Scope in Javascript

In Javascript, variables and functions have a scope, which defines their visibility and accessibility within the code. There are two main types of scope in Javascript:

- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of any function have global scope and are accessible throughout the code.

- **Local Scope**: Variables declared within a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function.

This concept of scope is essential for understanding how hoisting works in Javascript.

## How Hoisting Works

Javascript hoisting involves two main types of hoisting: **variable hoisting** and **function hoisting**.

### Variable Hoisting

In Javascript, variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, but not their initializations. This means that you can access a variable before it is declared, but its value will be `undefined`.

Let's look at an example:

```javascript
console.log(name); // Output: undefined
var name = "Alice";
```

In this example, the variable `name` is hoisted to the top of its scope, but its initialization (`name = "Alice"`) remains in place. This is equivalent to:

```javascript
var name;
console.log(name); // Output: undefined
name = "Alice";
```

To avoid confusion and potential bugs, it's recommended to always declare variables at the top of their scope.

### Function Hoisting

Function declarations are also hoisted to the top of their scope, allowing you to call a function before it is declared.

For example:

```javascript
greet(); // Output: Hello!

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

In this case, the function `greet` is hoisted to the top of its scope, making it accessible before its declaration.

Some important points to note about hoisting:

- Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
- Function declarations are hoisted before variable declarations.
- Hoisting can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood properly.

## Conclusion

Understanding hoisting is crucial for writing clean and bug-free Javascript code. By knowing how hoisting works, you can avoid common pitfalls and write more maintainable code. Remember to always declare variables and functions at the top of their scope to prevent hoisting-related issues.
